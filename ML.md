Calibrating Probability with Undersampling for Unbalanced Classification https://www3.nd.edu/~dial/publications/dalpozzolo2015calibrating.pdf
- Undersampling affects the prior probability and in-turn posterior probability


Long-Tail Learning via Logit Adjustment
- Proposes a method for long tailed label distribution fix
- logit adjustment for softmax based on label frequencies
-  Such adjustment encourages a large relative margin between logits of rare versus dominant labels
