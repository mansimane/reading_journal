This paper tries to reverse engineer Titktok "For you feed" recommendation algorithm. Major findings are
1. Two users who start from same feed will see different results if one User is scrolling and another user is viewing.
2. As a user interacts with specific posts in a certain way (e.g.,
likes them or watches them longer), that user will be served
more posts that are similar to the ones it interacted with.
3. Language and Location specific: Depending on the location
and language a user uses to access TikTok, the user will be
served different content.
4. As one of the two users interacts with its feed in a certain
way, the engagement rate of the posts recommended to that user will decrease, i.e. the number of views, likes, shares,
comments of recommended posts will become smaller as the
user will be served more "niche" content tailored to the userâ€™s
inferred interests rather than generally popular content.
